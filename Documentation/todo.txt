*Figure out why server prints exceptions when a client's password is wrong. This probably involves doing smarter things with exceptions than just printing their message and stack trace.
    -I suspect that the Server barfs on a client attempting a wrong password because the client attempts to do a discover anyway, and the ClientHandlerThread has no SecretKey to do anything with the clients request.
        #Easy fix: don't let client do discover unless they receive a LoginOk message

*Just as Server now handles Clients unexpectedly closing, so make the Client also handle that. The Server handling that starts in enterClientHandleLoop() where the SimplException is thrown

*Figure out why logging in as syreal with password a; then Ctrl-C; then repeat same login creds ends in a Login Deny

*Test that the Client can recognize a bad signature.
    -Easy way to test, give Client different public key
